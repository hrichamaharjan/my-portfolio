            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I am Hricha, a data enthusiast passionate about helping businesses make informed, evidence-based decisions. With a background in analytics and ongoing graduate studies in Business Analytics, I focus on turning raw data into meaningful stories.
            </p>
            <p>
              I specialize in data visualization using Tableau, perform predictive modeling in R, and bring insights through SQL, Python, and Excel. My goal is to bridge the gap between business needs and data solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm available for internships, part-time roles, or collaborations related to data storytelling, analytics, and dashboard development.
